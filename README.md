# natural-optimization
Exercises and projects to assign the natual optimization discipline from UFRJ/PEE.

This will include Metropolis Algorithm to generate distributions compliant with some target shape, Simulated Annealing (with variations) and Genetic Algorithms.

The final project is the implementation and methodological comparison of different genetic algorithms for clustering.

There is much duplicated code yet, refactoring to more OO programming paradigm, to solve this is pending.
